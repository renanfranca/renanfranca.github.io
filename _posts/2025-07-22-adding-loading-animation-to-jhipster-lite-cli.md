Have you ever run a command-line application and found yourself staring at a blank screen, wondering if it's still working or if it's frozen? That's exactly the problem I set out to solve for the JHipster Lite CLI project. In this post, I'll share how I implemented a loading animation to enhance the user experience while commands are executing.

## The Problem: Waiting in the Dark

When running commands in the JHipster Lite CLI, users had no visual feedback during operations that took more than a few seconds. This led to uncertainty - is the application still running? Is it stuck? Should I cancel and try again?

I wanted to fix [this issue](https://github.com/jhipster/jhipster-lite-cli/issues/13) by adding a loading animation that would provide visual feedback during command execution.

## The Solution: A Hexagonal ProgressStatus

I created a loading animation module that follows the hexagonal architecture principles that JHipster Lite is known for. Here's a demo of what I implemented:

![jhlite --version loading animation](https://renanfranca.github.io/img/adding-loading-animation-jhlite-cli/jhlite-version-loading-animation.gif)

## Exploring Available Libraries

Before implementing my own solution, I explored existing libraries:

1. **[magic-progress](https://github.com/lukfor/magic-progress)**: I tried using this library but encountered errors when running the `jhlite` command. Looking at the source code, I found no tests, and the project hadn't been maintained since August 2020.

2. **[progressbar](https://github.com/ctongfei/progressbar)**: This library didn't have spinner animations, which was a key requirement for our user experience.

Given these limitations, I decided to implement a custom solution that would perfectly fit our needs.

## The ProgressStatus Module

I created a `ProgressStatus` module following hexagonal architecture principles:

### Hexagonal Architecture Implementation

```bash
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ domain
‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ProgressStatus.java
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ infrastructure
‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ primary
‚îÇ¬†¬†     ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ SpinnerProgressStatus.java
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ package-info.java
```
The code follows a clean hexagonal architecture pattern:

1. **Domain Layer (Port)** - The `ProgressStatus` interface defines the core contract

      <script src="https://gist.github.com/renanfranca/810ef56bfc0b62a2b02c7b3c4e4bb8fa.js"></script>
   </details>

2. **Infrastructure Layer (Adapter)** - The `SpinnerProgressStatus` class implements the interface for spinner animation

      <script src="https://gist.github.com/renanfranca/f673c7098e71392d1e623d3efcaf273e.js"></script>
    
    </details>

This separation allows us to:
- Keep the core logic independent of visual animation implementation
- Easily test with mock implementations
- Add new progress indicator types without changing core logic

### Key Features

#### 1. Animated Unicode Spinner
The spinner uses Unicode braille patterns for a smooth rotating animation:

```java
private static final String[] SPINNER_FRAMES = { "‚†ã", "‚†ô", "‚†π", "‚†∏", "‚†º", "‚†¥", "‚†¶", "‚†ß", "‚†á", "‚†è" };
```

#### 2. Color-Coded Messages
The animation implements ANSI color support:
- Cyan for in-progress operations
- Green for success messages
- Red for failure notifications

#### 3. Asynchronous Animation
The spinner runs in a daemon thread to avoid blocking the main application:

```java
executor = Executors.newSingleThreadScheduledExecutor(r -> {
  Thread thread = new Thread(r, "spinner-animation");
  thread.setDaemon(true);
  return thread;
});
executor.scheduleAtFixedRate(this::renderFrame, 0, 120, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS);
```

#### 4. Thread-Safe Operation
The implementation uses atomic operations for thread safety:

```java
private final AtomicBoolean running = new AtomicBoolean(false);
```

#### 5. Rich Animation Sequences
I added sophisticated animation cycles including:
- Progressive dots (. .. ...)
- JHipster-lite symbols (‚ßì‚ö°)
- Hexagonal architecture symbol (üíé)
- Spring Boot symbol (üçÉ)

#### 6. Rendering Animation Logic

```java
private void renderSpinner(boolean updateFrame) {
 if (running.get()) {
   if (updateFrame) {
     frameIndex = (frameIndex + 1) % SPINNER_FRAMES.length;
     suffixFrameIndex = (suffixFrameIndex + 1) % SUFFIX_ANIMATION_FRAMES.length;
   }
   String frame = SPINNER_FRAMES[frameIndex];
   String suffix = SUFFIX_ANIMATION_FRAMES[suffixFrameIndex];
   System.out.print(CLEAR_LINE + ANSI_CYAN + frame + ANSI_RESET + " " + currentMessage + suffix);
 }
}
```

## The Little Details That Matter

A cool thing about this animation is that you don't mind if operations take a little longer because you can see different animations and progress indicators. I included some curious details:

1) The icons on the right represent the technology and architecture used by JHLiteCli. I synchronized the animation so it feels like you can see what is loading, but it's just an illusion.

2) If the Execute command takes a little bit longer, it shows the bow tie + lightning, which represents jhipster-lite. I designed the animation to match that style.

At the end, I felt the loading time isn't as bothersome as before. The user experience is much more relaxed and engaging.

## Usage Example

Here's a test case on how ProgressStatus works:

```java
@Test
void shouldShowSuccessMessage(CapturedOutput output) {
   ProgressStatus progressStatus = new SpinnerProgressStatus();
   progressStatus.show("Operation in progress");

   progressStatus.success("Completed successfully");

   assertThat(output.toString()).contains("‚úì").contains("Completed successfully");
}
```

## Benefits Beyond Aesthetics

This implementation provides several benefits:

1. **Improved User Experience**: Users now have visual feedback during operations
2. **Reduced Perceived Wait Time**: The animation makes waiting feel shorter
3. **Clear Operation Status**: Success and failure states are clearly indicated
4. **Architectural Consistency**: The solution follows JHipster's hexagonal architecture principles

## What‚Äôs next?

I am going to share how I integrated the ProgressStatus module into the JHipster Lite CLI for:

1. **Application Startup**: Shows "Loading JHipster Lite CLI" during initialization
2. **Command Execution**: Displays progress during command running
3. **Command Completion**: Shows success or failure messages with appropriate colors

The animation is going to be active for all major commands:
- Version command (--version)
- List command (list)
- Apply command (apply)

## Conclusion

Adding a loading animation to the JHipster Lite CLI might seem like a small enhancement, but it significantly improves the user experience. By following hexagonal architecture principles, I was able to create a solution that's not only visually appealing but also maintainable, testable, and extensible.

This project demonstrates how proper architectural design can benefit even UI components. The next time you're working on a command-line application, consider how you might enhance the user experience with similar feedback mechanisms.
