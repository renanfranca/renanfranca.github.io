I have been thinking that we type a lot of boilerplate code demanded by the technology before the business logic code.

Even though, as a backend developer, using Spring Boot Annotation, Lombok and maven archetype project doesn't completely solve this issue. Why didn't we already automate the development process itself?

After some research, I found JHipster which is a rapid application development platform for java web applications and microservices.

## Some of the JHipster options

* Generate simple monolith web applications

* Generate complete microservice architecture

* Generate domain model (entities)

* Generate Continuous Integration (CI)/Continuous Deployment (CD) pipelines

* Deploy to the cloud or containers

## I am using JHipster because I am tired of

* Create/Type entity classes

* Create/Type Repository, Services and Controllers classes with CRUD code

* Create integration test for CRUD operation 

* Create DTO classes

* Create Mapper classes

* Configure liquibase

* Configure Security

* Configure spring application yml for each environment
 
  * Database connection 

  * Spring profiles

  * Set framework/library properties

* Manually keep spring boot and the project dependencies updated

* Create yml files to deploy on Kubernetes

**I hope you have the time to try out [JHipster](https://www.jhipster.tech/)**. If you have any questions or just want to say something, please, use the comment section 😊
