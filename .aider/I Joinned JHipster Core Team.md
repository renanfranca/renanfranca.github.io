- 🌟 Excited to share my journey at JHipster  in the following posts!

- 🚀 It quickly turned into my main side project, where I get to apply the techniques I’m learning.

- 🛠️ Here, I truly discovered the power of Test-Driven Development (TDD).``

- 📚 Always growing and learning with this amazing community! 😊

- 🎉 I was elected to join the JHipster core team in 01/2024 after a successful vote by the members.



Below is how I introduced myself to the JHipster core team members in January/2024:

> My name is Renan Franca, and I have been a software engineer since 2008. I am a big fan of JHipster! I first encountered JHipster in 2021 while creating a side project to monitor my baby girl's status: https://renanfranca.github.io/i-built-a-baby-care-web-app-using-jhipster.html Since then, I have been maintaining a blog to promote JHipster https://renanfranca.github.io
> 
> My first contribution to the jhipster-generator was on 07/2021: https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/pull/15724. After blogging for a while, I decided to contribute to the JHipster Lite project and wrote about the experience here: https://renanfranca.github.io/how-did-i-earn-money-to-fix-an-issue-from-an-open-source-software.html. Then, I made 10 contributions to the JHipster Lite project (https://github.com/seed4j/seed4j/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3A%40me+is%3Aclosed).

> I'd like to join the core te````am because I truly love this project and the community. Recently, I realized my ambition isn't to create new side projects anymore. Now, my goal is to adopt the JHipster project as my primary side project.

## Today
I ve already contributed with more than 73 merged Pull Request at [Jhipster Lite Project](https://github.com/seed4j/seed4j/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Arenanfranca+is%3Amerged+).

I also contributed to the [JHipster Lite Extension project](https://github.com/seed4j/seed4j-extension) which demonstrate how to improve your own JHipster Lite in your own way. I ve got [7 merged Pull Requests merged](https://github.com/seed4j/seed4j-extension/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Arenanfranca+is%3Amerged+).

I am currently working in a CLI version of the JHLite which is called [JHipster Lite CLI Project](https://github.com/seed4j/seed4j-cli), I ve already has [9 Pull Requests merged](https://github.com/seed4j/seed4j-cli/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Arenanfranca+is%3Amerged+).  It's the first major project I'm building using jhipster-lite, and it marks my first experience coding with it 😀. More news will come!
